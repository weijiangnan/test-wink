# Introduction
During Android development, the build speed of the application directly affects the productivity of the developer's day. For large Android projects that have been maintained for several years, a single line of code change can potentially take more than 10 minutes to compile. Although Instant Run can bring some optimization, the optimization result is still minute level, Wink is created to solve this problem, for simple code changes, the compilation speed is improved to second level. Based on Gradle and Groovy, we optimize the compilation process for java, kotlin and resource files, and give the whole process to Gradle's Task system without using other scripting languages, which not only ensures the readability and ease of use of the project code, but also greatly improves the maintainability of the code.
