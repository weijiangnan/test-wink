<!-- Plugin description -->
Wink is a quick build plugin for AndroidStudio. Wink's goal is to build an easy-to-use and easy-to-maintain Android quick build plugin.
The difference between us and other quick build plugins is that our quick build process is fully implemented using Gradle and Java language, 
supporting quick compilation of java files, kotlin files and resource changes.
